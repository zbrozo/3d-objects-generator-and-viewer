# 3D objects generator
_Still in progress_ 

I started this project to have 3d objects for my Amiga 500 vector graphics renderer.

There are two apps:

- generator
- viewer 

run.sh is example script which generates several objects and show them in the viewer

Needed to build this app:

- SDL2 (with image and ttf)
- cmake
- g++
