# 3D objects generator
_Still in progress_ 

I started this project to have 3d objects for my Amiga 500 vector graphics renderer.

There are two apps:

- generator
- viewer 

run.sh is example script which generates several objects and show them in the viewer

Needed to build these libraries (in the brackets there are minimal versions I've tested):

- SDL2 (2.0.18)
- SDL2 image (2.8.2)
- SDL2 ttf (2.0.18)
- boost (1.71)
- cmake (3.16)
- g++ (C++17)
